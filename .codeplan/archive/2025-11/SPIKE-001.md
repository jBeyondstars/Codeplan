## Description

Research and evaluate drag-and-drop libraries for the Kanban board.

## Options Evaluated

1. **@dnd-kit/core** — Modern, accessible, great React support
2. **react-beautiful-dnd** — Deprecated, no longer maintained
3. **react-dnd** — Lower-level, more complex setup

## Decision

Use @dnd-kit/core for its accessibility features and active maintenance.
